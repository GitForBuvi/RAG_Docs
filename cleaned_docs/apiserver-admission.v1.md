AdmissionRequest     {#admission-k8s-io-v1-AdmissionRequest}
Appears in:

AdmissionReview

AdmissionRequest describes the admission.Attributes for the admission request.

FieldDescription

uid
k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/types.UID

uid is an identifier for the individual request/response. It allows us to distinguish instances of requests which are
otherwise identical (parallel requests, requests when earlier requests did not modify etc)
The UID is meant to track the round trip (request/response) between the KAS and the WebHook, not the user request.
It is suitable for correlating log entries between the webhook and apiserver, for either auditing or debugging.

kind
meta/v1.GroupVersionKind

kind is the fully-qualified type of object being submitted (for example, v1.Pod or autoscaling.v1.Scale)

resource
meta/v1.GroupVersionResource

resource is the fully-qualified resource being requested (for example, v1.pods)

subResource
string

subResource is the subresource being requested, if any (for example, "status" or "scale")

requestKind
meta/v1.GroupVersionKind

requestKind is the fully-qualified type of the original API request (for example, v1.Pod or autoscaling.v1.Scale).
If this is specified and differs from the value in "kind", an equivalent match and conversion was performed.
For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1 and apps/v1beta1, and a webhook registered a rule of
apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"] and matchPolicy: Equivalent,
an API request to apps/v1beta1 deployments would be converted and sent to the webhook
with kind: {group:"apps", version:"v1", kind:"Deployment"} (matching the rule the webhook registered for),
and requestKind: {group:"apps", version:"v1beta1", kind:"Deployment"} (indicating the kind of the original API request).
See documentation for the "matchPolicy" field in the webhook configuration type for more details.

requestResource
meta/v1.GroupVersionResource

requestResource is the fully-qualified resource of the original API request (for example, v1.pods).
If this is specified and differs from the value in "resource", an equivalent match and conversion was performed.
For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1 and apps/v1beta1, and a webhook registered a rule of
apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"] and matchPolicy: Equivalent,
an API request to apps/v1beta1 deployments would be converted and sent to the webhook
with resource: {group:"apps", version:"v1", resource:"deployments"} (matching the resource the webhook registered for),
and requestResource: {group:"apps", version:"v1beta1", resource:"deployments"} (indicating the resource of the original API request).
See documentation for the "matchPolicy" field in the webhook configuration type.

requestSubResource
string

requestSubResource is the name of the subresource of the original API request, if any (for example, "status" or "scale")
If this is specified and differs from the value in "subResource", an equivalent match and conversion was performed.
See documentation for the "matchPolicy" field in the webhook configuration type.
