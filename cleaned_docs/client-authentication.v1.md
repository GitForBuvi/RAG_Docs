Resource Types

ExecCredential

ExecCredential     {#client-authentication-k8s-io-v1-ExecCredential}
ExecCredential is used by exec-based plugins to communicate credentials to
HTTP transports.

FieldDescription

apiVersionstringclient.authentication.k8s.io/v1
kindstringExecCredential
spec [Required]
ExecCredentialSpec

Spec holds information passed to the plugin by the transport.

status
ExecCredentialStatus

Status is filled in by the plugin and holds the credentials that the transport
should use to contact the API.

Cluster     {#client-authentication-k8s-io-v1-Cluster}
Appears in:

ExecCredentialSpec

Cluster contains information to allow an exec plugin to communicate
with the kubernetes cluster being authenticated to.
To ensure that this struct contains everything someone would need to communicate
with a kubernetes cluster (just like they would via a kubeconfig), the fields
should shadow "k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd/api/v1".Cluster, with the exception
of CertificateAuthority, since CA data will always be passed to the plugin as bytes.

FieldDescription

server [Required]
string

Server is the address of the kubernetes cluster (https://hostname:port).

tls-server-name
string

TLSServerName is passed to the server for SNI and is used in the client to
check server certificates against. If ServerName is empty, the hostname
used to contact the server is used.

insecure-skip-tls-verify
bool

InsecureSkipTLSVerify skips the validity check for the server's certificate.
This will make your HTTPS connections insecure.

certificate-authority-data
[]byte

CAData contains PEM-encoded certificate authority certificates.
If empty, system roots should be used.

proxy-url
string

ProxyURL is the URL to the proxy to be used for all requests to this
cluster.

disable-compression
bool

DisableCompression allows client to opt-out of response compression for all requests to the server. This is useful
to speed up requests (specifically lists) when client-server network bandwidth is ample, by saving time on
compression (server-side) and decompression (client-side): https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112296.

config
k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.RawExtension

Config holds additional config data that is specific to the exec
plugin with regards to the cluster being authenticated to.
This data is sourced from the clientcmd Cluster object's
extensions[client.authentication.k8s.io/exec] field:
clusters:

name: my-cluster
cluster:
...
extensions:

name: client.authentication.k8s.io/exec  # reserved extension name for per cluster exec config
extension:
audience: 06e3fbd18de8  # arbitrary config

In some environments, the user config may be exactly the same across many clusters
(i.e. call this exec plugin) minus some details that are specific to each cluster
such as the audience.  This field allows the per cluster config to be directly
specified with the cluster info.  Using this field to store secret data is not
recommended as one of the prime benefits of exec plugins is that no secrets need
to be stored directly in the kubeconfig.

ExecCredentialSpec     {#client-authentication-k8s-io-v1-ExecCredentialSpec}
Appears in:

ExecCredential

ExecCredentialSpec holds request and runtime specific information provided by
the transport.

FieldDescription

cluster
Cluster

Cluster contains information to allow an exec plugin to communicate with the
kubernetes cluster being authenticated to. Note that Cluster is non-nil only
when provideClusterInfo is set to true in the exec provider config (i.e.,
ExecConfig.ProvideClusterInfo).

interactive [Required]
bool

Interactive declares whether stdin has been passed to this exec plugin.

ExecCredentialStatus     {#client-authentication-k8s-io-v1-ExecCredentialStatus}
Appears in:

ExecCredential

ExecCredentialStatus holds credentials for the transport to use.
Token and ClientKeyData are sensitive fields. This data should only be
transmitted in-memory between client and exec plugin process. Exec plugin
itself should at least be protected via file permissions.

FieldDescription

expirationTimestamp
meta/v1.Time

ExpirationTimestamp indicates a time when the provided credentials expire.

token [Required]
string

Token is a bearer token used by the client for request authentication.

clientCertificateData [Required]
string

PEM-encoded client TLS certificates (including intermediates, if any).

clientKeyData [Required]
string

PEM-encoded private key for the above certificate.
