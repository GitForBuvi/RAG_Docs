AuthInfo     {#AuthInfo}
Appears in:

NamedAuthInfo

AuthInfo contains information that describes identity information.  This is use to tell the kubernetes cluster who you are.

FieldDescription

client-certificate
string

ClientCertificate is the path to a client cert file for TLS.

client-certificate-data
[]byte

ClientCertificateData contains PEM-encoded data from a client cert file for TLS. Overrides ClientCertificate

client-key
string

ClientKey is the path to a client key file for TLS.

client-key-data
[]byte

ClientKeyData contains PEM-encoded data from a client key file for TLS. Overrides ClientKey

token
string

Token is the bearer token for authentication to the kubernetes cluster.

tokenFile
string

TokenFile is a pointer to a file that contains a bearer token (as described above).  If both Token and TokenFile are present,
the TokenFile will be periodically read and the last successfully read value takes precedence over Token.

as
string

Impersonate is the username to impersonate.  The name matches the flag.

as-uid
string

ImpersonateUID is the uid to impersonate.

as-groups
[]string

ImpersonateGroups is the groups to impersonate.

as-user-extra
map[string][]string

ImpersonateUserExtra contains additional information for impersonated user.

username
string

Username is the username for basic authentication to the kubernetes cluster.

password
string

Password is the password for basic authentication to the kubernetes cluster.

auth-provider
AuthProviderConfig

AuthProvider specifies a custom authentication plugin for the kubernetes cluster.

exec
ExecConfig

Exec specifies a custom exec-based authentication plugin for the kubernetes cluster.

extensions
[]NamedExtension

Extensions holds additional information. This is useful for extenders so that reads and writes don't clobber unknown fields

AuthProviderConfig     {#AuthProviderConfig}
Appears in:

AuthInfo

AuthProviderConfig holds the configuration for a specified auth provider.

FieldDescription

name [Required]
string

No description provided.

config [Required]
map[string]string

No description provided.

Cluster     {#Cluster}
Appears in:

NamedCluster

Cluster contains information about how to communicate with a kubernetes cluster

FieldDescription

server [Required]
string

Server is the address of the kubernetes cluster (https://hostname:port).

tls-server-name
string

TLSServerName is used to check server certificate. If TLSServerName is empty, the hostname used to contact the server is used.

insecure-skip-tls-verify
bool

InsecureSkipTLSVerify skips the validity check for the server's certificate. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure.

certificate-authority
string

CertificateAuthority is the path to a cert file for the certificate authority.

certificate-authority-data
[]byte

CertificateAuthorityData contains PEM-encoded certificate authority certificates. Overrides CertificateAuthority

proxy-url
string

ProxyURL is the URL to the proxy to be used for all requests made by this
client. URLs with "http", "https", and "socks5" schemes are supported.  If
this configuration is not provided or the empty string, the client
attempts to construct a proxy configuration from http_proxy and
https_proxy environment variables. If these environment variables are not
set, the client does not attempt to proxy requests.
socks5 proxying does not currently support spdy streaming endpoints (exec,
attach, port forward).

disable-compression
bool

DisableCompression allows client to opt-out of response compression for all requests to the server. This is useful
to speed up requests (specifically lists) when client-server network bandwidth is ample, by saving time on
compression (server-side) and decompression (client-side): https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112296.

extensions
[]NamedExtension

Extensions holds additional information. This is useful for extenders so that reads and writes don't clobber unknown fields

Context     {#Context}
Appears in:

NamedContext

Context is a tuple of references to a cluster (how do I communicate with a kubernetes cluster), a user (how do I identify myself), and a namespace (what subset of resources do I want to work with)

FieldDescription

cluster [Required]
string

Cluster is the name of the cluster for this context

user [Required]
string

AuthInfo is the name of the authInfo for this context

namespace
string

Namespace is the default namespace to use on unspecified requests

extensions
[]NamedExtension

Extensions holds additional information. This is useful for extenders so that reads and writes don't clobber unknown fields

ExecConfig     {#ExecConfig}
Appears in:

AuthInfo

ExecConfig specifies a command to provide client credentials. The command is exec'd
and outputs structured stdout holding credentials.
See the client.authentication.k8s.io API group for specifications of the exact input
and output format

FieldDescription

command [Required]
string

Command to execute.

args
[]string

Arguments to pass to the command when executing it.

env
[]ExecEnvVar

Env defines additional environment variables to expose to the process. These
are unioned with the host's environment, as well as variables client-go uses
to pass argument to the plugin.

apiVersion [Required]
string

Preferred input version of the ExecInfo. The returned ExecCredentials MUST use
the same encoding version as the input.

installHint [Required]
string

This text is shown to the user when the executable doesn't seem to be
present. For example, brew install foo-cli might be a good InstallHint for
foo-cli on Mac OS systems.

provideClusterInfo [Required]
bool

ProvideClusterInfo determines whether or not to provide cluster information,
which could potentially contain very large CA data, to this exec plugin as a
part of the KUBERNETES_EXEC_INFO environment variable. By default, it is set
to false. Package k8s.io/client-go/tools/auth/exec provides helper methods for
reading this environment variable.

interactiveMode
ExecInteractiveMode

InteractiveMode determines this plugin's relationship with standard input. Valid
values are "Never" (this exec plugin never uses standard input), "IfAvailable" (this
exec plugin wants to use standard input if it is available), or "Always" (this exec
plugin requires standard input to function). See ExecInteractiveMode values for more
details.
If APIVersion is client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1 or
client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1, then this field is optional and defaults
to "IfAvailable" when unset. Otherwise, this field is required.

ExecEnvVar     {#ExecEnvVar}
Appears in:

ExecConfig

ExecEnvVar is used for setting environment variables when executing an exec-based
credential plugin.
