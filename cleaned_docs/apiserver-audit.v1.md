sourceIPs

Source IPs, from where the request originated and intermediate proxies.
The source IPs are listed from (in order):

X-Forwarded-For request header IPs
X-Real-Ip header, if not present in the X-Forwarded-For list
The remote address for the connection, if it doesn't match the last
IP in the list up to here (X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-Ip).

UserAgent records the user agent string reported by the client.
Note that the UserAgent is provided by the client, and must not be trusted.

objectRef

Object reference this request is targeted at.
Does not apply for List-type requests, or non-resource requests.

responseStatus
meta/v1.Status

The response status, populated even when the ResponseObject is not a Status type.
For successful responses, this will only include the Code and StatusSuccess.
For non-status type error responses, this will be auto-populated with the error Message.

requestObject
k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Unknown

API object from the request, in JSON format. The RequestObject is recorded as-is in the request
(possibly re-encoded as JSON), prior to version conversion, defaulting, admission or
merging. It is an external versioned object type, and may not be a valid object on its own.
Omitted for non-resource requests.  Only logged at Request Level and higher.

responseObject

API object returned in the response, in JSON. The ResponseObject is recorded after conversion
to the external type, and serialized as JSON.  Omitted for non-resource requests.  Only logged
at Response Level.

requestReceivedTimestamp

Time the request reached the apiserver.

stageTimestamp
meta/v1.MicroTime

Time the request reached current audit stage.

annotations
map[string]string

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with an audit event that may be set by
plugins invoked in the request serving chain, including authentication, authorization and
admission plugins. Note that these annotations are for the audit event, and do not correspond
to the metadata.annotations of the submitted object. Keys should uniquely identify the informing
component to avoid name collisions (e.g. podsecuritypolicy.admission.k8s.io/policy). Values
should be short. Annotations are included in the Metadata level.

EventList     {#audit-k8s-io-v1-EventList}
EventList is a list of audit Events.

Policy     {#audit-k8s-io-v1-Policy}
Appears in:

PolicyList

Policy defines the configuration of audit logging, and the rules for how different request
categories are logged.

FieldDescription

apiVersionstringaudit.k8s.io/v1
kindstringPolicy
metadata
meta/v1.ObjectMeta

ObjectMeta is included for interoperability with API infrastructure.
Refer to the Kubernetes API documentation for the fields of the metadata field.

rules [Required]
[]PolicyRule

Rules specify the audit Level a request should be recorded at.
A request may match multiple rules, in which case the FIRST matching rule is used.
The default audit level is None, but can be overridden by a catch-all rule at the end of the list.
PolicyRules are strictly ordered.

omitStages
[]Stage

OmitStages is a list of stages for which no events are created. Note that this can also
be specified per rule in which case the union of both are omitted.

omitManagedFields
bool

OmitManagedFields indicates whether to omit the managed fields of the request
and response bodies from being written to the API audit log.
This is used as a global default - a value of 'true' will omit the managed fileds,
otherwise the managed fields will be included in the API audit log.
Note that this can also be specified per rule in which case the value specified
in a rule will override the global default.

PolicyList     {#audit-k8s-io-v1-PolicyList}

FieldDescription

impersonationConstraint
string

ImpersonationConstraint is the verb associated with the constrained impersonation mode that was used to authorize
the ImpersonatedUser associated with this audit event.  It is only set when constrained impersonation was used.
