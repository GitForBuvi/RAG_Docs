CredentialProviderConfig     {#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1alpha1-CredentialProviderConfig}
CredentialProviderConfig is the configuration containing information about
each exec credential provider. Kubelet reads this configuration from disk and enables
each provider as specified by the CredentialProvider type.

FieldDescription

apiVersionstringkubelet.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kindstringCredentialProviderConfig
providers [Required]
[]CredentialProvider

providers is a list of credential provider plugins that will be enabled by the kubelet.
Multiple providers may match against a single image, in which case credentials
from all providers will be returned to the kubelet. If multiple providers are called
for a single image, the results are combined. If providers return overlapping
auth keys, the value from the provider earlier in this list is attempted first.

ImagePullIntent     {#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1alpha1-ImagePullIntent}
ImagePullIntent is a record of the kubelet attempting to pull an image.

FieldDescription

apiVersionstringkubelet.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kindstringImagePullIntent
image [Required]
string

Image is the image spec from a Container's image field.
The filename is a SHA-256 hash of this value. This is to avoid filename-unsafe
characters like ':' and '/'.

ImagePulledRecord     {#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1alpha1-ImagePulledRecord}
ImagePullRecord is a record of an image that was pulled by the kubelet.
If there are no records in the kubernetesSecrets field and both nodeWideCredentials
and anonymous are false, credentials must be re-checked the next time an
image represented by this record is being requested.

FieldDescription

apiVersionstringkubelet.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kindstringImagePulledRecord
lastUpdatedTime [Required]
meta/v1.Time

LastUpdatedTime is the time of the last update to this record

imageRef [Required]
string

ImageRef is a reference to the image represented by this file as received
from the CRI.
The filename is a SHA-256 hash of this value. This is to avoid filename-unsafe
characters like ':' and '/'.

credentialMapping [Required]
map[string]ImagePullCredentials

CredentialMapping maps image to the set of credentials that it was
previously pulled with.
image in this case is the content of a pod's container image field that's
got its tag/digest removed.
Example:
Container requests the hello-world:latest@sha256:91fb4b041da273d5a3273b6d587d62d518300a6ad268b28628f74997b93171b2 image:
"credentialMapping": {
"hello-world": { "nodePodsAccessible": true }
}

CredentialProvider     {#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1alpha1-CredentialProvider}
Appears in:

CredentialProviderConfig

CredentialProvider represents an exec plugin to be invoked by the kubelet. The plugin is only
invoked when an image being pulled matches the images handled by the plugin (see matchImages).

FieldDescription

name [Required]
string

name is the required name of the credential provider. It must match the name of the
provider executable as seen by the kubelet. The executable must be in the kubelet's
bin directory (set by the --image-credential-provider-bin-dir flag).
Required to be unique across all providers.

matchImages [Required]
[]string

matchImages is a required list of strings used to match against images in order to
determine if this provider should be invoked. If one of the strings matches the
requested image from the kubelet, the plugin will be invoked and given a chance
to provide credentials. Images are expected to contain the registry domain
and URL path.
Each entry in matchImages is a pattern which can optionally contain a port and a path.
Globs can be used in the domain, but not in the port or the path. Globs are supported
as subdomains like *.k8s.io or k8s.*.io, and top-level-domains such as k8s.*.
Matching partial subdomains like app*.k8s.io is also supported. Each glob can only match
a single subdomain segment, so *.io does not match *.k8s.io.
A match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true:

Both contain the same number of domain parts and each part matches.
The URL path of an imageMatch must be a prefix of the target image URL path.
If the imageMatch contains a port, then the port must match in the image as well.

Example values of matchImages:

123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
*.azurecr.io
gcr.io
*.*.registry.io
registry.io:8080/path

defaultCacheDuration [Required]
meta/v1.Duration

defaultCacheDuration is the default duration the plugin will cache credentials in-memory
if a cache duration is not provided in the plugin response. This field is required.

apiVersion [Required]
string

Required input version of the exec CredentialProviderRequest. The returned CredentialProviderResponse
MUST use the same encoding version as the input. Current supported values are:

credentialprovider.kubelet.k8s.io/v1alpha1

args
[]string

Arguments to pass to the command when executing it.

env
[]ExecEnvVar

Env defines additional environment variables to expose to the process. These
are unioned with the host's environment, as well as variables client-go uses
to pass argument to the plugin.

ExecEnvVar     {#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1alpha1-ExecEnvVar}
Appears in:

CredentialProvider

ExecEnvVar is used for setting environment variables when executing an exec-based
credential plugin.

FieldDescription

name [Required]
string

No description provided.

value [Required]
string

No description provided.

ImagePullCredentials     {#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1alpha1-ImagePullCredentials}
Appears in:

ImagePulledRecord

ImagePullCredentials describe credentials that can be used to pull an image.

FieldDescription

kubernetesSecrets
[]ImagePullSecret

KuberneteSecretCoordinates is an index of coordinates of all the kubernetes
secrets that were used to pull the image.

kubernetesServiceAccounts
[]ImagePullServiceAccount

KubernetesServiceAccounts is an index of coordinates of all the kubernetes
service accounts that were used to pull the image.

nodePodsAccessible
bool

NodePodsAccessible is a flag denoting the pull credentials are accessible
by all the pods on the node, or that no credentials are needed for the pull.
If true, it is mutually exclusive with the kubernetesSecrets field.

ImagePullSecret     {#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1alpha1-ImagePullSecret}
Appears in:

ImagePullCredentials

ImagePullSecret is a representation of a Kubernetes secret object coordinates along
with a credential hash of the pull secret credentials this object contains.

FieldDescription

namespace [Required]
string

No description provided.

name [Required]
string

No description provided.

credentialHash [Required]
string

content of the secret specified by the UID/Namespace/Name coordinates.

ImagePullServiceAccount     {#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1alpha1-ImagePullServiceAccount}
Appears in:

ImagePullCredentials

ImagePullServiceAccount is a representation of a Kubernetes service account object coordinates
for which the kubelet sent service account token to the credential provider plugin for image pull credentials.
