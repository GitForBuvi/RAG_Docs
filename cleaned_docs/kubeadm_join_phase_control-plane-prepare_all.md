Synopsis
Prepare the machine for serving a control plane

Options

--apiserver-advertise-address string

If the node should host a new control plane instance, the IP address the API Server will advertise it's listening on. If not set the default network interface will be used.

--apiserver-bind-port int32     Default: 6443

If the node should host a new control plane instance, the port for the API Server to bind to.

--certificate-key string

Use this key to decrypt the certificate secrets uploaded by init. The certificate key is a hex encoded string that is an AES key of size 32 bytes.

--config string

Path to a kubeadm configuration file.

--control-plane

Create a new control plane instance on this node

--discovery-file string

For file-based discovery, a file or URL from which to load cluster information.

--discovery-token string

For token-based discovery, the token used to validate cluster information fetched from the API server.

--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash strings

For token-based discovery, validate that the root CA public key matches this hash (format: "<type>:<value>").

--discovery-token-unsafe-skip-ca-verification

For token-based discovery, allow joining without --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash pinning.

--dry-run

Don't apply any changes; just output what would be done.

-h, --help

help for all

--node-name string

Specify the node name.

--patches string

Path to a directory that contains files named "target[suffix][+patchtype].extension". For example, "kube-apiserver0+merge.yaml" or just "etcd.json". "target" can be one of "kube-apiserver", "kube-controller-manager", "kube-scheduler", "etcd", "kubeletconfiguration", "corednsdeployment". "patchtype" can be one of "strategic", "merge" or "json" and they match the patch formats supported by kubectl. The default "patchtype" is "strategic". "extension" must be either "json" or "yaml". "suffix" is an optional string that can be used to determine which patches are applied first alpha-numerically.

--tls-bootstrap-token string

Specify the token used to temporarily authenticate with the Kubernetes Control Plane while joining the node.

--token string

Use this token for both discovery-token and tls-bootstrap-token when those values are not provided.

Options inherited from parent commands

--rootfs string

The path to the 'real' host root filesystem. This will cause kubeadm to chroot into the provided path.
