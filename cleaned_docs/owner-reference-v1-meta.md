OwnerReference {#OwnerReference}
OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.

FieldDescription

apiVersion *string
API version of the referent.

blockOwnerDeletionboolean
If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#foreground-deletion for how the garbage collector interacts with this field and enforces the foreground deletion. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

controllerboolean
If true, this reference points to the managing controller.

kind *string
Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#names

uid *string
UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#uids
