Decide whether you want to deploy a cloud or local cluster.

Creating a Calico cluster with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Prerequisite: gcloud.

To launch a GKE cluster with Calico, include the --enable-network-policy flag.
Syntax
shell
gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --enable-network-policy
Example
shell
gcloud container clusters create my-calico-cluster --enable-network-policy

To verify the deployment, use the following command.
shell
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
The Calico pods begin with calico. Check to make sure each one has a status of Running.

Creating a local Calico cluster with kubeadm
To get a local single-host Calico cluster in fifteen minutes using kubeadm, refer to the 
Calico Quickstart.

Once your cluster is running, you can follow the Declare Network Policy to try out Kubernetes NetworkPolicy.
