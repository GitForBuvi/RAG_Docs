This page shows how to configure a pod using image volumes. This allows you to
mount content from OCI registries inside containers.

The container runtime needs to support the image volumes feature
You need to exec commands in the host
You need to be able to exec into pods

Run a Pod that uses an image volume {#create-pod}
An image volume for a pod is enabled by setting the volumes[*].image field of .spec
to a valid reference and consuming it in the volumeMounts of the container. For example:
{{% code_sample file="pods/image-volumes.yaml" %}}

Create the pod on your cluster:

shell
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/image-volumes.yaml

Attach to the container:

shell
   kubectl exec image-volume -it -- bash

Check the content of a file in the volume:

shell
   cat /volume/dir/file
The output is similar to:
none
   1
You can also check another file in a different path:
shell
   cat /volume/file
The output is similar to:
none
   2
Use subPath (or subPathExpr)
It is possible to utilize
subPath or
subPathExpr
from Kubernetes v1.33 when using the image volume feature.
{{% code_sample file="pods/image-volumes-subpath.yaml" %}}

Create the pod on your cluster:

shell
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/image-volumes-subpath.yaml

Attach to the container:

shell
   kubectl exec image-volume -it -- bash

Check the content of the file from the dir sub path in the volume:

shell
   cat /volume/file
The output is similar to:
none
   1
