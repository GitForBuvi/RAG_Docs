This page explains how to upgrade a Windows node created with kubeadm.

* Familiarize yourself with the process for upgrading the rest of your kubeadm
cluster. You will want to
upgrade the control plane nodes before upgrading your Windows nodes.

Upgrading worker nodes
Upgrade kubeadm

From the Windows node, upgrade kubeadm:
```powershell
replace {{< skew currentPatchVersion >}} with your desired version
curl.exe -Lo   "https://dl.k8s.io/v{{< skew currentPatchVersion >}}/bin/windows/amd64/kubeadm.exe"
```

Drain the node

From a machine with access to the Kubernetes API,
    prepare the node for maintenance by marking it unschedulable and evicting the workloads:
```shell
replace  with the name of your node you are draining
kubectl drain  --ignore-daemonsets
```
You should see output similar to this:
node/ip-172-31-85-18 cordoned
node/ip-172-31-85-18 drained

Upgrade the kubelet configuration

From the Windows node, call the following command to sync new kubelet configuration:
powershell
kubeadm upgrade node

Upgrade kubelet and kube-proxy

From the Windows node, upgrade and restart the kubelet:
powershell
stop-service kubelet
curl.exe -Lo <path-to-kubelet.exe> "https://dl.k8s.io/v{{< skew currentPatchVersion >}}/bin/windows/amd64/kubelet.exe"
restart-service kubelet

From the Windows node, upgrade and restart the kube-proxy.
powershell
stop-service kube-proxy
curl.exe -Lo <path-to-kube-proxy.exe> "https://dl.k8s.io/v{{< skew currentPatchVersion >}}/bin/windows/amd64/kube-proxy.exe"
restart-service kube-proxy

{{< note >}}
If you are running kube-proxy in a HostProcess container within a Pod, and not as a Windows Service,
you can upgrade kube-proxy by applying a newer version of your kube-proxy manifests.
{{< /note >}}
Uncordon the node

From a machine with access to the Kubernetes API,
bring the node back online by marking it schedulable:
```shell
replace  with the name of your node
kubectl uncordon 
```
